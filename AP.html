    <p>The Advanced Placement Program enables willing and academically prepared students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school, with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or both.

        ACS currently offers a variety of AP courses. To remain enrolled in a course for the second semester, students must maintain a grade average above or equal to a C and may not miss more than five classes. Students enrolled in AP courses are required to take the AP Exams, given each year in May.
        
        Because of the rigor of an AP course students who earn a C or above will receive an additional 0.5 points in their GPA, provided they sit for the official AP exam in May.
        
        While students are encouraged to take AP courses, ACS has the following recommendations for students signing up: 
        
        Students wishing to take three AP courses should have a GPA greater than 3.5.
        
        Students wishing to take two AP courses should have a GPA greater than 3.0.
        
        Students with a cumulative GPA lower than 3.0, should confer with their counselor before signing up for any AP courses.
        
        Students wishing to take more than 3 AP courses must get Principal approval.</p>

        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 250%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">AP Capstone Diploma</h2>
        <p>The American Community School has adopted the Advanced Placement (AP) Capstone as part of the high school program. AP Capstone is a diploma program that was launched by the College Board as of the 2014-2015 school year. 

            AP Capstone will complement the existing AP program and is comprised of two courses: AP Seminar and AP Research. 
            
            Students can take AP Seminar in the 11th or 12th grade, followed by AP Research. Students will receive the AP Capstone Diploma when they earn scores of 3 or higher in AP Seminar and AP Research and on four additional AP Exams they select in high school. 
            
            The AP Capstone Diploma will signify the students' outstanding college-level academic achievement and research skills. 
            
            Students may also receive the AP Seminar and Research Certificate as an alternative to the fill Capstone Diploma by earning scores of 3 or higher in AP Seminar and AP Research without taking additional AP courses. This will signify their attainment of college-level academic and research skills
