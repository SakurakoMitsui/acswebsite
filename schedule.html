        <h1>Learning Support</h1>
        <p>The American Community School is committed to maximizing student learning and achievement through a comprehensive and robust educational plan that includes intervention and enrichment that best suits the individual needs of students. The school focuses on a holistic approach that values the whole child, and takes into account their academic, social and emotional needs.

            ACS offers a Learning Support (LS) program for children with mild learning difficulties. ACS defines students with mild learning difficulties as those who require some additional support in identified areas of need such as reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), mathematics (dyscalculia), and executive functioning skills (resulting from ADHD or organizational challenges) in order to succeed in ACS’s academic program. Students with mild learning difficulties do not require modification to the mainstream educational program. ACS incorporates a combination of push in and pull out support for students enrolled in Learning Support.</p>

        <h1>Admission Procedure</h1>  
        <p>Parents must complete the online application. If a review of the records and recommendations raises any concerns the school will contact the parents to request additional information or clarification which may also include getting permission from the parent to contact the previous school. Updated evaluations may also be requested. In cases where the records alone do not provide a clear picture of the applicant’s ability to be a successful student at ACS, it may be necessary to screen the applicant before the child is admitted. The team completing the screening will give careful consideration to factors such as:
            Student's age
            School records:
            academic level/performance
            attendance
            behavior (effort, attention concerns, social/emotional/behavior concerns)
            Type of program at former school (for example, school calendar, age to grade relationship, accredited program)
            Time of the year student is seeking admission
            English language development
            Self-help skills
            Special services required (i.e. educational support programs)
            Grade level applied for
            Physical abilities/limitations
            When the screening has been completed, a recommendation will be formulated as to whether the school can meet the child's needs.</p>  
            <h1>Learning Support Program</h1>
            <h2>Intervention</h2>
            <p>ACS' Learning Support program is built on a Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS). The model maximizes school resources to ensure the success of all students and uses data to guide instruction, assessment and intervention. Individual Learning Plans (ILP) are developed for students enrolled in the LS program. The ILPs determine the type of support and accommodations a student receives. The goal of the program is to support students with mild learning difficulties in the areas of reading, writing, math, processing skills and organizational skills. If Learning Support and other strategies are not sufficient to help a student be successful in the regular education classroom, ACS reserves the right to request that parents obtain further testing from outside professionals and/or provide a qualified, native English speaking tutor at the parents’ expense. If interventions and provided supports are not successful, parents will be asked to find an alternative educational placement for their child. When a student is transitioning from Elementary to Middle School, or from Middle School to High School, ACS may deny admission to the next grade if performance and records indicate the student has not gained the necessary skills to be successful and/or has learning needs beyond the scope of support of the next division.</p>  
            <h2>Enrichment </h2> 
            <p>ACS provides opportunities for enrichment and extension that are integrated into our existing educational program. Through the Multi Tier System of Support (MTSS), data is collected using formative and universal assessments which guide the teachers in offering differentiated instruction for students.</p>  ACS provides opportunities for enrichment and extension that are integrated into our existing educational program.

            <h1>Individual Learning Plans</h1>
            <p>An Individual Learning Plan (ILP) is developed for each student enrolled in the Learning Support program. This plan outlines individualized goals, objectives, and accommodations to promote student learning and success. The ILP is reviewed and updated annually to ensure the goals and objectives reflect the student’s current needs in order to promote continued academic growth.</p>
